            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> It's 1930's London, and the Paige Turner family and friends have gathered
                at Barbara Paige Turner's Meddleton Manor, to celebrate the sixtieth birthday of her son, Clive Paige
                Turner.</p>
            <p>The guests enjoyed drinks in the drawing room at 7pm, before sitting down to a formal dinner at 7:30pm.
                Dinner was served promptly at 8pm.</p>
            <p>Some guests went straight to the drawing room, others didn't. There were various comings and goings
                throughout the evening. During the course of the evening Barbara Paige Turner was murdered. She was a
                rich, brash, colourful author who was very outspoken. Her husband died just after they got married and
                she lived her life to the fullest. Her death beyond her 60th birthday was a shock to all.</p>
            <p>She was known for her successful series of books called Larry Plotter, which had successfully sold all
                over the world. This had made her even richer than she was before. All the fame and money had gone to
                her head and she began to abuse her wealth and dominated her family and friends by attempting to meddle
                in everyone's affairs.</p>
            <p>Everyone at the dinner had a good reason for wanting her dead but who actually had the guts to go through
                with it? Maybe it was you?!</p>
